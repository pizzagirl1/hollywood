If your goal is to connect Lucy Liu to Adam Sandler, you could go from Drew Barrymore to 50 First Dates, which also stars Adam Sandler.

    "text_3": "To begin, you’ll be dealt two groups of three stars. Pick a star from the first group to be your starting point, and a star from the second group to be your end point. If you aren’t familiar with some of the stars you’ve been dealt, you can click “Mulligan” to get new options before starting the game. Once you are ready, click “Start Game!” At any point, you can switch the start and end points by clicking “Change Direction,” but you will lose any progress you have made.",
